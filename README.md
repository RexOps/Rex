# Rex [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RexOps/Rex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RexOps/Rex)

With (R)?ex you can manage all your boxes from a central point through the complete process of configuration management and software deployment.

## Getting started

We have a [Getting started guide](http://www.rexify.org/docs/guides/start_using__r__ex.html) on the website that should help you with the first steps.

## Installation

There are several methods to install (R)?ex: use your distro's package manager, download it from CPAN or build it from source. Check out the [Get Rex](http://www.rexify.org/get.html) page on the website for the different options, and choose the one that fits you best.

### Build from source

To build (R)?ex from source, you need to install [Dist::Zilla](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla):
```
cpanm Dist::Zilla
```

Dist::Zilla provides the *dzil* command, which you can use to install (R)?ex dependencies:
```
dzil authordeps --missing | cpanm
dzil listdeps --missing | cpanm
```

Then to install (R)?ex:
```
dzil install
```

Or to build a .tar.gz release file:
```
dzil build
```
