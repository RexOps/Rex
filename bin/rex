=head1 Rexfile

When you run C<rex> it reads the file C<Rexfile> in the current working
directory. A Rexfile consists of 2 major parts: Configuration and Task
Definitions.

=head2 Configuration

=head3 Simple Authentication

    user "bruce";
    password "batman";
    pass_auth;

=head3 Key Authentication

    private_key "/path/to/your/private/key.file";
    public_key "/path/to/your/public/key.file";

=head3 Define Logging

    logging to_file => "rex.log";
    logging to_syslog => "local0";

=head3 Group your servers

Rex gives you the ability to define groups of servers. Groups can be defined the Rexfile:

    group "frontends" => "frontend01", "frontend02", "frontend03", "frontend04", "frontend[05..09]";

Groups can also be defined in a B<server.ini> file:

    [frontends]
    frontend[01..04]

=head2 Other Configuration

    timeout 10;    # ssh timeout
    parallelism 2; # execute tasks in parallel

=head2 Defining tasks

A basic task looks like this:

    # task description
    desc "This task tells you how long since the server was rebooted";
   
    # task definition
    task "shortname", sub {
        say run "uptime";
    };

You can also set a default server group:

    desc "This is a long description of a task";
    task "shortname", group => "frontends", sub {
        say run "uptime";
    };

=head1 TAB COMPLETION

Tab completion scripts are provided for Bash and Zsh in the L<share|https://metacpan.org/release/Rex/source/share> directory. They provide completions for the available CLI options, hosts, groups, environments and tasks.
